# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection System

## Overview
This project is a distributed system for detecting and predicting plant diseases using deep learning.  
Users can upload plant images and receive predictions, confidence scores, and treatment recommendations.

## Architecture
The system consists of three main components:

- **Web Gateway (Django)**  
  Handles the user interface, authentication, and requests.

- **AI Service (gRPC + CNN)**  
  Processes images using a trained deep learning model.

- **Database (SQLite)**  
  Stores users and analysis history.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Django  
- gRPC  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- SQLite  

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection
```

### 2. Setup environments and install dependencies

#### AI Service
```bash
cd ai_service
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Web Gateway
```bash
cd web_gateway
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Application

### 1. Start AI Service
```bash
cd ai_service
python server.py
```

### 2. Start Web Server
```bash
cd web_gateway
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Access
Open your browser and go to:  
http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Project Structure
```bash
ai_service/      # AI inference service (gRPC + CNN model)
web_gateway/     # Django web application
```

## Notes
- Start the AI service before the web server  
- Use Python 3.10 or higher  
- Each service has its own virtual environment  
- Do not share dependencies between services
